The cavern power plant Reisseck II will be erected 1,585 m above sea level in the mountain and equipped with two powerful pump turbines.\r\n\r\nSimilar to a normal storage power plant, Reisseck II will produce peak electricity in high demand periods, whereby water will be transported via a works water channel from Great Mühldorfer Lake to the two turbines that drive the generators. The processed water will run into a lower basin.\r\n\r\nBoth of the machines units in the mountain can be switched to pump operation, whereby the generators will then function as motors and the turbines will pump the water from the lower basin back up to the upper basin. Pump operation will take place during the day when the European grid is carrying more electricity than is required by the consumers. Energy which, for example, comes from the large wind farms or the Danube power plants can be saved in the form of pumped-up water. The pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will therefore function as a \green battery\ in the Alps. The power plant will have a capacity of 430 megawatt (MW), both in turbine and pump operation. This corresponds to the electricity generating capacity of approximately 200 wind turbines.\r\n\r\nOn completion of the rock cavern for the power plant in 2011, the boring of the works water channel to Great Mühldorfer Lake commenced in the first half of 2012 with an 880-ton (t) and 220 m tunnel boring machine.

687		1/01/1956	Kaprun Upper Stage Pumped Storage Power Plant	Austria	113000	0	Operational	"desc:History of the Power Plant\r\n\r\nThe initial planning for the power plant facilities in the Kaprun Valley date back to the \centralisation project\ of the Allgemeine Elektricitätsgesellschaft (AEG) Berlin [General Power Company]. The planned pooling of all the water from the Hohe Tauern into the Kaprun Valley was interrupted due to the outbreak of the global economic crisis at the beginning of the 1930's. With Austria's annexation to the German Reich in the spring of 1938, the project was once again made a high priority and re-designed under the head of the newly founded Alpen Elektrowerke AG (AEW [Alpine Power Company]), Hermann Grengg. The new plans contemplated a two stage pumped storage power plant with an upper storage reservoir on the Mooserboden and Wasserfallboden storage lakes above the Limberg Alp. The construction work began with the construction of new and expansion of existing access roads to the construction sites, in particular to the Kapruner Winkel [Kaprun Corner], the building site of the Hauptstufe [main stage] power house, and to the Limberg Alp. When the war ended, the Hauptstufe power house and a makeshift dam on the Wasserfallboden were ready for operation.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the Oberstufe [upper stage] power house could not begin, however until completion of the Limberg dam, which was to connect airside to the new structure. In the final phase of the work on the barrier, more and more attention was given to the archtectonic design of the Limberg power house. To this end, an invitation to tender was held to design of the crown of dam and powerhouse with architect Harald Bauer's design being selected. For the power house however, the third-placed architect Edith Lassmann's design was selected.\r\n\r\nThe contract was awarded at the beginning of 1951 and the excavation work for the power house to be attached to the nearly completed dam began immediately thereafter. Between May and August 1951 alone, around 10,000 m³ of rock was removed from the area of the foundations for the new power house.

The dam's spillway is controlled by seven radial gates, which, along with four regulating conduits at the bottom of the dam, give the dam a total maximum discharge of 112,000 cubic feet per second (3,200 m3/s). Hiwassee Lake stretches along the river for approximately 22 miles (35 km) to the town of Murphy, North Carolina, and has 180 miles (290 km) of shoreline, a storage capacity of 434,000 acre·ft (535,000 dam3) and 205,590 acre·ft (253,590 dam3) of flood storage. The reservoir's operating level varies by roughly 38 feet (12 m) in a typical year.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1950s, TVA experimented with the idea of \pumped storage\ at Hiwassee Dam. There it employed an energy-generating turbine that was run in reverse during low-demand hours to pump water below the dam into the upper reservoir. This integration of pump and turbine was the first of its kind in the United States; further, at the time it was the largest and most powerful in the world. The unit was built by Allis-Chalmers Company.

In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel.\r\n\r\nWater is diverted from the Niagara River—up to 375,000 gallons a second—and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.\r\n\r\nAt night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant's reservoir.\r\n\r\nDuring the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October.

Electrical generators are turned by water flowing from a reservoir on top of Proffit Mountain into a lower reservoir on the East Fork of the Black River. The generators and turbines at river level are reversible, and at night the excess electricity available on the power grid is used to pump water back to the mountaintop.\r\n\r\nThe Taum Sauk plant is notable in that it is a pure pump-back operation – there is no natural primary flow available for generation, unlike most other pumped storage sites. It was among the largest such projects when it was built. Construction of the Taum Sauk plant began in 1960 and operation began in 1963. The two original reversible pump-turbine units were each capable of generating 175 megawatts of power. They were upgraded in 1999 to units capable of 225 megawatts each.\r\n\r\nThe plant was out of operation after the upper reservoir suffered a catastrophic failure on December 14, 2005, until the rebuilt and recertified structure started producing power again on April 21, 2010. The new upper reservoir dam, rebuilt from the ground up, is the largest roller-compacted concrete dam in North America. The plant was named an IEEE Milestone in 2005."	http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/dams/taum-sauk/watkins-taum-sauk-gsa_branson-compressed.pdf	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity											iso:MISO	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Missouri	size_kwh_hours:8	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-06-14T23:28:08Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-06-14T23:28:08Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:Ameren	utility_type:Investor Owned	vendor_company:	zip:

Large screens inside the intake towers are opened to activate the high-pressure downflow.\r\n\r\n27 cubic metres of water per second are discharged through two high-pressure shafts (each 200 metres in depth), which are connected to four concrete-lined tunnels. Steel penstocks then direct the discharge into the station via inlet pipes and valves to start generation.\r\n\r\nWater is captured in Tan-y-Grisiau and pumped back to Llyn Stwlan, usually overnight, to complete the cycle.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.fhc.co.uk/ffestiniog.htm"	http://www.fhc.co.uk/ffestiniog.htm	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity				null	null	null	null	null	null	null	iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Gwynedd	size_kwh_hours:6	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Closed-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Closed-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Closed-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2013-12-07T08:10:04Z	updated_at_by_admin:2013-12-06T21:12:39Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

Opened by the Queen in October 1965, it is one of four pumped storage power schemes in the UK, and has the distinction of being the world's first high head reversible pumped-storage hydro scheme. The station has also been used as the setting for several films, including the James Bond film The World is not Enough.\r\n\r\nNicknamed The Hollow Mountain, Cruachan was constructed between 1959 and 1954 and is unique in that the station is concealed within the hollowed out rock of Ben Cruachan, 3,694 feet (1,126 m), which overlooks the visitor centre. It was conceived and designed by Sir Edward MacColl, a Scottish engineer and a pioneer of hydro electricity in Scotland, with numerous projects to his credit. The only visible features are the dam, which is 1,000 feet (316 m) wide and located 1,300 feet (390 m) up the mountain, and the station offices and visitor centre, which lie on the loch side below the dam, and next to the road.\r\n\r\nBuried in the mountain and accessed by a tunnel 23 feet (7 m) wide and 13 feet (4 m) high, the main cavern houses four motor-generator sets capable of generating a total output of 440 MW. Construction of the main cavern, similar in size to a football pitch, required the excavation of 220,000 cubic metres of rock and soil.\r\n\r\nThe station can operate for 22 hours before the supply of water in the reservoir is exhausted, and is required to maintain a 12 hour emergency supply in reserve. Figures given for the Foyers scheme show that the system can raise 167 tonnes of water (167 cubic metres) per second when pumping at full power, with the flow rate increasing to 200 tonnes per second when generating at full power."	http://www.visitcruachan.co.uk/	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity	Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning	Load Following (Tertiary Balancing)									iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Dalmally	size_kwh_hours:22	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-06-28T00:33:27Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-06-28T00:33:27Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:Scottish Power	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

Spain has one of the most dynamic markets for pumped storage in southern Europe with a total installed capacity of 5, 350 MW in operation against a total estimated potential of 13,000 MW. Spain is slated to construct additional projects in the coming decades. One government report on renewable energy plans for 2011-2020 estimates a target installed capacity of about 6,300 MW by 2015 and 8,800 MW by 2020.

545		26/11/1966	La Rance Tidal Power Station	France	240000	0	Operational	"desc:La Rance Tidal Power Plant is located at the estuary of the Rance, in the municipality of La Richardais in Ille-et-Vilaine. It draws its energy from the force of the tide by using a tidal barrage. Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam, a tidal barrage first allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide, and releasing the water back during low tide. This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are then placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.\r\n\r\nThe station's 24 reversible bulb pump-turbines are used to pump water into the river basin at high tide (for ebb generation). This energy is more than returned during generation, because power output is strongly related to the head. If water is raised 2 ft (61 cm) by pumping on a high tide of 10 ft (3 m), this will have been raised by 12 ft (3.7 m) at low tide. The cost of a 2 ft rise is returned by the benefits of a 12 ft rise. This is because the correlation between the potential energy is not a linear relationship, but rather, is related by the square of the tidal height variation."	http://energie.edf.com/hydraulique/energies-marines/carte-des-implantations-marines/usine-maremotrice-de-la-rance/presentation-51516.html	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity	Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning	Frequency Regulation	Voltage Support	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Ille-et-Vilaine	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2014-08-14T22:48:10Z	updated_at_by_admin:2013-08-27T04:45:55Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:Électricité de France (EDF)	utility_type:Investor Owned	vendor_company:	zip:

It is a pumped storage plant with a lower and upper reservoir. During periods of peak electricity demand on Xcel Energy’s Colorado system, electricity is generated by releasing water from the upper reservoir through a tunnel, which turns the turbine generators. The water is then stored in the lower reservoir. In the early hours of the morning when electricity use by the company’s customers is low, water is pumped back to the upper reservoir.\r\n\r\nAs a hydroelectric station, Cabin Creek produces no air, water or land emissions. As we bring additional wind power onto our Colorado system, Cabin Creek can help us better utilize this resource. The pumping of water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir can be timed during the evening or early morning when wind generators are producing more power.\r\n\r\nThe Georgetown plant is also open to the public as the Georgetown Energy Museum, where one can see a working power plant.

It created the Allegheny Reservoir, a lake that stretches 25 miles (40 km) upriver.\r\n\r\nThe power plant, rated at 435 MW, was built by the Pennsylvania Electric Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. It began commercial operation in 1970. Through business mergers and acquisitions, the plant is now owned by FirstEnergy, an operator of several base load (nuclear and coal-fired) power plants. Pumped storage plants function similarly to a storage battery; they absorb excess power generated by such plants in off-peak hours, such as nighttime, using it to pump water into a reservoir. Later, when demand exceeds the base load, the flow of water from the reservoir generates additional electrical power to meet peak load demands."	http://www.lspower.com/News/newsarticle07232015.htm	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning											iso:PJM	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:	state:Pennsylvania	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-06-14T22:57:02Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-06-14T22:57:02Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

It is owned and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Its construction was in response to growing power demands and a lack of dam sites on the Grand River. The first phase was completed in 1968 and the second in 1971. The upper reservoir for the power station is Lake W. R. Holway which was built on Saline Creek and the lower reservoir is Lake Hudson on the Grand River. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.\r\n\r\nThe project was constructed in two stages:\r\n\r\nStage 1 consisted of building an earth and rock filled dam in Chimney Rock Hollow 185 feet (56 m) high, creating Chimney Rock Reservoir. A canal 1,850 feet (560 m) long led from the dam to a forebay structure that had openings for steel penstocks,each 14 feet (4.3 m) in diameter. Three penstocks led from the forebay to a powerhouse that housed three 64,000 horsepower pump-generators, with a total rated capacity of 130 megawatts. This stage was completed in 1968.\r\n\r\nStage 2 comprised building three more penstocks, extending the powerhouse and adding three more pump-generators, all identical to those installed in Stage 1. This doubled the facility's capacity to 260 mw. It was completed in 1971.\r\n\r\nThe SPSP is controlled remotely from the GRDA Energy Control Center at the Robert S.

Keys III Pump-Generating Plant (formerly known as Grand Coulee Pump-Generating Plant) pumps water uphill 280 feet from Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to Banks Lake. This water is used to irrigate approximately 670,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin Project. More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation\r\n\r\nConstruction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant. \r\n\r\nIn the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts.

The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy.\r\nThe plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes. Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy. Local residents still refer to the plant as “The Project”.\r\n\r\nOne of the world’s biggest electric “batteries”, Ludington can provide energy at a moment’s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators. Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan.\r\nAt night, when electric demand is low, Ludington’s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or “penstocks”, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity.\r\nThe plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts — enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energy’s system.\r\nLudington’s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michigan’s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the company’s baseload plants. The immense size of Ludington and its six-unit design offers flexibility in balancing customer demand with electric output on a moment’s notice. \r\n\r\nConsumers Energy and Detroit Edison announced an $800 million upgrade on February 7 2011. The six year project would begin in 2013 and extend the plant's life by at least forty years and upgrade the generating capacity from 1,872 megawatts to 2,172 megawatts."	http://www.consumersenergy.com/content.aspx?id=1830	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity	Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning	Load Following (Tertiary Balancing)									iso:MISO	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Michigan	size_kwh_hours:8	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-06-14T00:31:37Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-06-14T00:31:37Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:Consumers Energy	utility_type:Public Owned	vendor_company:	zip:

Pump-storage schemes use off-peak energy to pump water to a reservoir on a higher level. This water then passes through turbines to generate electricity when prices are higher. The sole powerhouse is located above ground, approximately 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) below Talbingo Dam. \r\n\r\nThe power station is fitted with six Toshiba turbines, three of which are reversible pump-turbines. All six turbines are equipped with Melco-manufactured generators, and they have a combined generating capacity of 1,500 megawatts (2,000,000 hp) of electricity. \r\n\r\nThe power station was completed in 1973, and has 150.9 metres (495 ft) rated head. Water is pumped through six pipelines, each 488 metres (1,601 ft) long and 5.6 metres (18 ft) in diameter, delivering water to Talbingo Reservoir. \r\n\r\nDuring 2003, Snowy Hydro commissioned six 140 kilowatts (190 hp) micro-hydro generators on the existing cooling water systems on each of the six generating units at Tumut 3 Power Station. These GreenPower accredited units enable Snowy Hydro to save approximately 3,137 tonnes (3,458 short tons) of carbon dioxide per annum. In addition, this installation not only captures previous wasted renewable energy, but also will be substantially reducing the noise that was associated with the previous pressure reducing valves on the six generating unit's cooling systems. Between 2009 and December 2011, there was a major upgrade of Tumut 3, adding additional capacity in the range of 25 megawatts (34,000 hp) to 50 megawatts (67,000 hp) per unit."	http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity				null	null	null	null	null	null	null	iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:New South Wales	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2014-08-14T23:02:18Z	updated_at_by_admin:2013-06-13T18:08:27Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:Toshiba	zip:

The scheme was redeveloped to focus on pumped-storage in 1969, having been purchased by the Hydro Board from the British Aluminium Company (BAC). The scheme was originally built by BAC in 1896 and was the first large-scale commercial hydro-electric scheme in the UK, used to power an aluminium smelter also located here until this closed in 1967. BAC created a reservoir by joining two small lochs to form Loch Mhor, which lies 179 m above Loch Ness and 2 miles away.\r\n\r\nDuring the redevelopment, a 5 MW turbine was installed in the original power station building to replace the original plant and provide pure hydro-electric generation, while the tunnels and pipes which carried the water were reused. The River Fechlin was diverted into Loch Mhor to provide additional water and, to support the pumped-storage system, new tunnels and a further power station were built.\r\n\r\nA new power station was built to house two 150 MW Francis generation-motor sets, each weighing 914 tonnes, with 5 m wide turbine blades. 100 cubic meters of water pass through each turbine and out into the loch every second during generation. The turbines can be brought from a standstill to full power output in less than two minutes, which makes the station extremely responsive to demand.

Spain has one of the most dynamic markets for pumped storage in southern Europe with a total installed capacity of 5, 350 MW in operation against a total estimated potential of 13,000 MW. Spain is slated to construct additional projects in the coming decades. One government report on renewable energy plans for 2011-2020 estimates a target installed capacity of about 6,300 MW by 2015 and 8,800 MW by 2020. Iberdrola, Gas Natural Fenosa (GNF), and Endesa are the three main utilities that are expected to undertake these developments to fulfill the government objective."	http://www.iberdrola.es/webibd/gc/prod/en/doc/INFORMEANUAL.pdf	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity											iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Orense	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-05-02T06:03:42Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-04-29T20:37:53Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

Pumpback turbines are reversible, so they allow the system to re-use water stored in the reservoir system multiple times. This capability is especially helpful during hot, dry summers when the facility can provide more peak-demand electricity with the same amount of water again and again.\r\n\r\nThe pumpback units are typically operated seven days a week but only during the night. By pumping back at night-time, the system maximizes the benefit to taxpayers because night-time electricity costs about a third less than day-time electricity (due to decreased power demand).\r\n\r\nStarting about one hour after sunset, the designated generators are switched into pumpback mode. Once they reverse direction, these units pull water from below the Russell Dam (in the upper portion of Thurmond Lake) and pump it back upstream into Russell Lake. Then, the next day during peak power demands, electricity is generated by releasing that water back down into Thurmond Lake."	http://balancingthebasin.armylive.dodlive.mil/2013/02/27/pumpback-2/	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity											iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Georgia	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-06-14T23:37:35Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-06-14T23:37:35Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

Plans of the Österreichische Bundesbahnen followed after 1945. In 1952, Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) carried out water and energy-related tests and created a plan for the utilisation of the Malta and Gößbäche with a three-stage power plant group. A dissertation written in 1956 at the technical university in Graz by Erich Magnet with the title \Winter Storage Plant Inner Maltatal-Kolbnitz\ was used by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG and proved to be very important for the development of the project.\r\n\r\nThe water rights negotiations for the Malta upper stage and Malta main stage power plants took place in 1964. The approval of the water authorities was granted in 1965. Heavy protests, especially from the Austrian Society for Nature Conservation, followed when the project area lost its nature conservation status. The conservationists called for the erection of nuclear power stations as an alternative to storage power plants. The detailed planning commenced in 1971 following the positive construction decision.\r\n\r\nIn addition to covering demand peaks, it was required that the power plant group Malta must, at all times, be in a position to provide reserve power for a failed nuclear power plant. The earlier-than-expected issuing of the building decision and the new requirements created major challenges for the planning and construction departments. In addition, the first machine unit for the main stage was to be commissioned two years earlier than expected on 1 December 1978. The planning was carried out, inter alia, by Construction Director Kurt Baustädter, Rudolf Mußnig, Kurt Landl, Heiner Ludescher and Georg Lichtenegger from Draukraftwerke AG. External planners, such as the civil technology company Ehß, were also engaged. The architectural work was carried out by Rudolf Nitsch from Klagenfurt.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of geological tests, the final location for Rottau power plant was fixed in 1973. The excavation pit reached a depth of approximately 30 metres below the valley basin and 25 metres below the groundwater level. Extensive safety measures were necessary to prevent the penetration of groundwater. The first machine unit was commissioned in Rottau power plant in late autumn 1976. The storage pumps were commissioned in summer 1978.

The decision by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) to construct the three-stage Malta power plant, however, did not follow until 1957. The power plants comprise an upper stage with Kölnbrein reservoir and Galgenbichl power house, the main stage with Galgenbichl reservoir in the upper Malta valley between Gamskarnock and Lausnock, the main stage power house in Rottau near Kolbnitz in the Möll valley as well as the lower stage with a diversion channel in the Möll valley and Möllbrücke power house in the Drau valley.\r\n\r\nGiven that it had only been established for a short time, ÖDK did not, however, have the financial resources necessary to construct the Reißeck, Kreuzeck and Malta power plants at the same time. For this reason, detailed planning did not commence until 1961 following the completion of the Reißeck-Kreuzeck power plants. In 1965, the Malta-Upper Stage and Malta-Main Stage projects were approved by the water authorities.\r\n\r\nThe construction work for Galgenbichl power house followed after commencement of work on the Kölnbrein Dam and the Galgenbichl reservoir. The construction warehouse was extended in April 1974 and work on the development of the construction site commenced. Machinery and equipment from the neighbouring construction site at Galgenbichl Dam were used during the construction period.\r\n\r\nThe excavation work commenced in the east section of the power house, and due to the tight time schedule, continued through winter 1974/75. The work to stabilise the 40-metre cliff to the west of the power house to which parts of the building are attached proved to be a major challenge.\r\nAn external firm was commissioned to supply and prepare 800 tons of twisted ribbed steel so as to save time by working parallel. In spite of weather-related delays, work on the assembly of the first machine commenced on 1 September 2022 and the assembly of the second machine followed in 1976.\r\n\r\nThe power house was handed over to ÖDK on 1 September 1976.

This group consists of the Finstertal reservoir which is the upper reservoir of the Kühtai Pumped storage hydro power plant. The Kühtai pumped storage hydro power plant has the Längental reservoir as lower reservoir. This lower reservoir is at the same time the upper reservoir of the Sellrain-Silz High head hydropower schmen. Only the Kühtai power plant has pumping capabilities.\r\n \r\nSince the Längentals-reservoir is fed with fresh water the PSH Kühtai is an open loop PSH. The Sellrain-Silz power plant is only a high head hydropower scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Finstertal reservoir is located at an altitude of 2300 meters above sea level and has a capacity of 60 million m³. The dam's embankment is 149 meters high with a crest length of 650 meters, which contains 4.5 million m³ of rock.\r\n\r\nThe Finstertal reservoir sits at an altitude of 1900 meters above sea level on the southeastern shore of the Längental reservoir. The power plant uses a shaft power design, which means that the components are vertically arranged and the majority of the cylindrical power plant building is located underground. The building has a diameter of 30 meters and a depth of 82 meters. The plant contains two Francis turbines with pump and power generation abilities. Both turbines can process 66m ² of water per second.\r\n\r\nThe reservoir Längental, often referred to as cache Längental, is located 400 meters below Finstertal reservoir and acts as intermediate storage with 1/20th of Finstertal's storage capacity. There are 13 mountain streams that continuously supply the reservoir. Water can either be pumped back into the Finstertal reservoir via the Kühtai Pumped Hydro Station or the water can flow down stream for electricity production via the Silz power station.\r\n\r\nThe Silz power plant sits at an altitude of 643 meters above sea level. The power plant contains two Silz Pelton turbines which rotate at 500 revolutions per minute.

It is a construction with daily water accumulation that participates in the functioning of the frequency regulation and of the distribution of electricity to the grid. This hydraulic structure consists of four parts: an upper and a lower reservoir, penstocks and a power station. The lower reservoir was created by means of damming up the valley of the ?ierny Váh by a 375 m long dam. Its capacity is 5.1 million m3. The level fluctuates by 7.45 m between elevations 726.00 – 733.45 m. The upper reservoir of an irregular shape is situated between the valleys of the Biely Váh and the ?ierny Váh. It has a maximum capacity of 3.7 million m3 of water and the level fluctuates by 25 m between the elevation points 1160 – 1135 m above sea level. The sealing of the slopes and of the bottom is provided by one layer of asphalt concrete sealing blanket with a surface of approximately 200,000 m2. Underneath the reservoir, there is an inspection tunnel that should collect the potential seepages from the reservoir bottom and slopes. The hydraulic connection of the upper and lower reservoir is ensured via three pressure penstocks which have an internal diameter of 3.8 m. In the valley, they split into pipes that transport the water to the two turbines and outlets of water from the two accumulation pumps. The maximum head between the upper and the lower reservoirs is 434 m. The lower reservoir dam includes also a power station with a control room. There are six pumping turbo aggregates installed that comprise a motor generator, a Francis turbine and an accumulation pump. When 6 accumulation pumps are in operation, it takes 8 hours to pump the water into the upper reservoir.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.skcold.sk/priehrady/nova_databaza_priehrad/pve_cierny_vah/"	http://www.seas.sk/sk/elektrarne/typy-elektrarni/vodne/cierny-vah	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity	Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning	Frequency Regulation	Voltage Support	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Liptov	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2014-08-14T22:46:24Z	updated_at_by_admin:2013-09-06T18:27:08Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	"vendor_company:CKD, Skoda"	zip:

Construction began in 1973 and the dam was complete in 1981 while the power station was commissioned in 1986. It is 116 m (381 ft) tall and withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of 14,800,000 m3 (11,999 acre·ft). Of that capacity, 13,000,000 m3 (10,539 acre·ft) is active (or useful) for power generation. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage power station is created by the Fujiwara Dam, located 4 km (2 mi) to the northwest on another Tone River tributary. Power is generated during periods of high energy demand and pumping occurs during times when energy demand is low such as at night. The power station contains four 300 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper Tamahara Reservoir is at an elevation of 1,177 m (3,862 ft) and the lower Fujiwara Reservoir is at 651 m (2,136 ft) which affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of 518 m (1,699 ft).

848		1/01/1986	Aldeadávila Hydro Power Station	Spain	1139000	0	Operational	"desc:The Aldeadávila Dam has a 422 MW pumped-storage capability. The dam's power plant contains 2 x 211 MW pumped-storage generators than can generate power in the normal way by allowing water to flow through its turbines. However, during periods when the demand for electricity is low (such as evenings, weekends, or during seasonal fluctuations), the dam can use its excess power generating capacity to pump water back into the reservoir—enhancing reservoir capacity and storing water for periods when the demand for electricity is high. At the time it was constructed, the Aldeadávila Dam had the largest pumping station in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe Aldeadávila Dam has two diversion tunnels, each 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in length. Each tunnel has a 53-metre (174 ft) high surge tank. The dam also contains more than 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of tunnels which divert water to the electrical generation turbines. There are six penstock tunnels, each about 5 metres (16 ft) in diameter. The design of the penstocks and auxiliary spillways using these tunnels has proved to be an issue, however. Cavitation problems have damaged these tunnels in the past. Until the Alcantara Dam was built in 1969, the Aldeadávila Dam was the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. As of 2010, it remains the largest in Spain. The dam's hydroelectric power station originally housed six 170,000 horsepower (130,000 kW) Francis turbines which generated 718 MW, about half that of Hoover Dam.In 1987, the Aldeadávila II power station extension was completed, boosting generating capacity by 400 MW.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.exergy.se/goran/hig/ses/06/hydro.pdf"	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldead%C3%A1vila_Dam	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity				null	null	null	null	null	null	null	iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:	state:Salamanca	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2014-08-14T22:35:38Z	updated_at_by_admin:2013-11-25T03:48:40Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

The medium-head part of the power station with 2 Kaplan turbines with total installed capacity of 22.5 MW (2x11.25 MW) was commissioned in 1944. The pumped-storage power station was initially built between 1941 and 1947. After many years of intensive exploitation, it was shut down in 1991 and reconstructed between 1991 and 1996. Instead of two sets arranged in three stages of total capacity of 42 MW it is now equipped with a single set of a reversing Francis turbine and a motor generator, which give a total capacity of 220 MWh. The set is installed in an underground generator room built in a pit which is approximately 45 m high. The power station includes also two outdoor switching stations, 110 kV and 22 kV. Both parts of the power station are fully automatic and are controlled remotely from the Control Room of the Vltava Cascade. \r\n\r\nThe Št?chovice water reservoir was built between 1938 and 1944. The concrete dam with a granite revetment is 22.5 m high and 120 m long, with five spillways with crest gates. These spillways with the capacity of 2,400 m3/s are able to handle floods as catastrophic as the one in 1890.\r\n\r\nThe medium-head power station is equipped as a classic run-off-river hydroelectric power station, with two sets of Kaplan turbines.

The four-unit station began generating electricity in 1991, and is the largest hydroelectric station on the Duke Energy system. It is named for the two streams, Bad Creek and West Bad Creek, which were dammed to create the Bad Creek reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.\r\n\r\nA pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were “recharging” a battery. Using power from other generating stations, the generators act as electric motors spinning the huge turbines backward. This pumps water back up the power tunnels into the upper lake. Water is generally pumped back to the upper reservoir at night and on weekends.\r\n\r\nWith the reservoir at full-pond elevation and generating with all four units, Bad Creek can generate for 24 hours within its maximum 160’ drawdown. Full pond elevation is 2310 MSL (Mean Sea Level)."	http://www.duke-energy.com/power-plants/pumped-storage-hydro/bad-creek.asp	null	Electric Energy Time Shift												iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:South Carolina	size_kwh_hours:24	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-06-20T17:40:49Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-06-20T17:40:49Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:Duke Energy	utility_type:Investor Owned	vendor_company:	zip:

New Waddell Dam's primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam's reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP's construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.\r\n\r\nHandicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year's operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam. If the reservoir's flood storage capacity is ever exceeded, water can also be released over spillways located west of the dam. This water would flow down Morgan City Wash and back to the Agua Fria River about one mile below the dam.\r\n\r\nThe cost of constructing New Waddell Dam was more than $625 million. The Central Arizona Water Conservation District, which operates and maintains the CAP, is repaying $175 million of this cost."	http://www.usbr.gov/lc/phoenix/projects/waddelldamproj.html	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity											iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Arizona	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2016-06-15T21:18:28Z	updated_at_by_admin:2016-06-15T21:18:28Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

Total capacity is 3,200 MWh.\r\n\r\nThe power station fulfills static, dynamic and compensatory functions within the power system. The static function lies in converting the surplus energy in the system into peak-load energy - at periods of surplus electricity in the system, namely at night, water is pumped from the lower to the elevated storage reservoir; and during the on-peak periods, when there is a shortage of electricity, the power station’s turbines generate electricity. The dynamic function of the hydroelectric power station means functioning as the system’s output reserve, generating the regulating output and energy, and participating in the frequency regulation of the system. The compensatory operation facilitates the voltage regulation within the power system.\r\n\r\nThe lower reservoir is on the Divoká Desná River, 820 m above sea level. Its total capacity is 3.4 million m3 of water; it has a 56 m high dam, and its water level fluctuates by 22.2 m. The elevated reservoir is situated on top of the Dlouhé Strán? mountain, 1,350 m above sea level.

To achieve this, two machine groups with 120 MW capacity each will be installed in a new cavern that is currently being excavated. The construction work has been in progress since 7 April 2011. After its commissioning, which is scheduled for the end of 2015, the pumped storage power station with one billion kWh of peak energy per year will generate virtually twice as much electricity as at present (520 million kWh). In order to achieve this, Forces Motrices Hongrin-Léman SA (FMHL), in which Alpiq holds a share of almost 40 percent, is investing 331 million Swiss francs. The pumped storage power station Veytaux will play a crucial role in supplying electricity to the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The project is the response to the increasing demand for balancing energy, which has been triggered by the rapid development of the new renewable energies that generate energy in an intermittent and fluctuating manner. Thanks to its high degree of flexibility, the Veytaux power station is able to quickly balance out such fluctuations. At peak times, the water from the Hongrin reservoir is channelled through the turbines of the Veytaux power station located 800 metres lower down, while during off-peak times, the excess energy is used to pump water from Lake Geneva up to the Hongrin reservoir. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the Hogrin-Leman is a separate plant."	http://www.alpiq.com/what-we-offer/our-assets/hydropower/storage-power-plants/forces-motrices-hongrin-lman-fmhl.jsp	null	Electric Energy Time Shift	Electric Supply Capacity				null	null	null	null	null	null	null	iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:Transmission	state:Montreux	size_kwh_hours:0	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2014-06-26T22:02:51Z	updated_at_by_admin:2014-06-26T22:01:03Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

This new form of pumped hydro storage system is based on an underground \r\nstorage reservoir, where the water is enclosed in a membrane with up to 25 meters of soil on top.\r\n\r\nThe overlaying soil gives the necessary pressure to run a pump/turbine and store large amount of electrical energy, corresponding to the pressure created by the level difference in the well-known pumped storage system.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration plant measures 50 x 50 meters and the average pumping head is 1 meter. Thus, it contains a total of 2 500 m3 water. The plant is covered by a 3-meter soil layer.\r\n\r\nGiven the chosen dimensions, the membrane can store 34 kWh. It may not sound like much, but if the energy membrane is scaled by a factor 10 in all three dimensions, the stored amount of energy will reach 200 MWh which equals 8 hours of energy consumption by 50 000 single-family houses.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the demonstration plant is to test the geotechnical conditions and to prepare a mathematical model for the pumped storage. Furthermore, the project is to uncover the challenges and possibilities in storing energy in an underground pumped storage, in both environmental and technical as well as in economic terms.\r\n\r\nThe next step – a pilot plant sized 200 x 200 meters – will be based on the experiences from this demonstration plant.\r\n\r\nhttp://godevelopment.dk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Energy-membrane_PPT_211211.pdf"	http://godevelopment.eu/?page_id=44#	null	Renewables Capacity Firming	Renewables Energy Time Shift				null	null	null	null	null	null	null	iso:N/A	decommissioning_on:null	master_project_id:null	projected_lifetime:null	rdd_status:No	research_desc:	research_institution:	research_institution_link:	siting:	state:Nybøl	size_kwh_hours:6	size_kwh_minutes:0.0	technology_type:Closed-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l1:Closed-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l2:Closed-loop Pumped Hydro Storage	technology_type_l3:Pumped Hydro Storage	updated_at:2014-08-08T23:30:25Z	updated_at_by_admin:2014-08-08T23:30:25Z	updated_by:null	updated_by_email:null	utility:	utility_type:	vendor_company:	zip:

This permitted significant improvements in the system efficiency of the company's network of hydroelectric and thermal-electric power generating plants.\r\n\r\nWith Candlewood Lake and the Housatonic River differing in elevation by 200 feet, the Rocky River plant uses a single penstock, 1,000 feet long, to carry water downhill and lift it uphill. The Rocky River plant's pair of 8,100-horsepower pumps together are capable of lifting a million gallons every four minutes. At the time of their installation, they were largest of their kind in the world. \r\n\r\nThe Rocky River plant pumps water when the Housatonic River runs high. When the river runs low, water released from the lake to create electricity also raises the river level, helping generate additional power at two downriver plants.

689			Roßhag Pumped Storage Power Plant	Austria	231000	0	Operational	"desc:History of the Power Plant\r\n\r\nSince Roßhag power plant is located in an avalanche-prone area, it was necessary for the entire construction to be carried out with appropriately solid material, whereby the construction elements are able to withstand a pressure of 20 to 50 t/m². A total of ten deep borehole explosions had to be carried out in the excavation of the construction pit. The building is in paint-ready, in-situ concrete, supplemented by prefabricated concrete units, executed and divided into three blocks of roughly equal lengths by means of expansion joints. The roof over the machinery hall comprises prefabricated, reinforced concrete components. The uphill-facing distribution lines were embedded in a solid concrete block.\r\n\r\nStrain was nevertheless caused by the encasing in concrete of the pumps and turbine coils, as well as the firm anchoring of the building with the rock. In the surface construction, pillars were covered with concrete at intervals of some 6 m and connected via two 8 or 15 m reinforced concrete girders that lay across the operating floor. The lower girder is connected to the rock by means of high tensile bars; the upper girder serves for slope stabilisation and simultaneously forms the uphill support for the roofing slab. The flat roofs are landscaped with vegetation. The concrete surfaces have a light-coloured interior coating; the floors of the machinery hall and the upper part of the walls are clad with red clinker slabs.
