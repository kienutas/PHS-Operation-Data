Generation data from https://transparency.entsoe.eu/
Need to create an account to log in and download.
UTAS somehow blocked the confirmation email from that domain (entsoe), so the account was created in Gmail.

Files:
1. download_raw_data: MATLAB code to download the raw data, save in folder of each country
2. countrycode.xlsx: every data set and country has different code. The accurate html link with accurate code is needed to download the file automatically by MATLAB script. The "countrycode" can be found in the html link, or by inspecting page source by web browser.
